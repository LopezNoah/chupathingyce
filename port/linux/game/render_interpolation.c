/*
RENDER_INTERPOLATION.C

Frames between the game's 30 Hz ticks, for the native ports (port/linux,
port/android, port/windows; see port/linux/README.md, "Frame rate").

The game simulates in 30 Hz ticks and originally drew one frame per tick.
The ports draw at the display's refresh rate instead, and every frame shows
the world between the last two ticks: after each tick the camera, every
object's node matrices and the first-person weapon's pose are kept, and a
frame blends the previous and the latest by how far the game clock has run
into the next tick. That puts what is drawn one tick (33 ms) behind the
simulation, the usual price of interpolation. (A Catmull-Rom spline would
also need the tick after the pair it spans: two ticks behind.)

Rotations are blended as quaternions (normalised lerp, taking the shorter
way round), positions and scales linearly. Anything that moves further than
a tick of motion plausibly allows (teleports, respawns, camera cuts) snaps
instead of sweeping across the world, and so does a pose whose nodes moved
too far for one tick: two snapshots of different poses (a model swapped,
another weapon's skeleton, a pose left from seconds before) blended node by
node stretch vertices across the screen.

Particles, contrails and other effects already move every frame
(game_frame), so they need nothing here.

An object the distributed netcode moves to where the host has it
(port/linux/game/network_objects.c) is drawn gliding there over a few ticks
rather than jumping: its snapshots move with it, and the difference is drawn
on top of it, whole until the next tick and fading from then on (no more than
a few world units of it: further is a jump). A local player's view glides so
with their unit, and with what it rides.
