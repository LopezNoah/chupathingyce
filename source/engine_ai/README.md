# Reusable AI primitives

These bounded, caller-owned C modules were imported from `engine/main` and
adapted for Halo's native build. They have no ECS or simulation/timeline header
dependencies. Halo's existing campaign actor AI under `source/ai/` is unchanged.

- `behavior.*`: iterative priority/sequence/leaf trees, validation, cancellation,
  reevaluation and bounded traces (128 nodes, 16 levels).
- `intent.*`: one actor's decision-to-execution batch, with game-owned identity,
  tick and revision types; up to 32 requests with 64-byte copied payloads.
  Execution validates epoch/tick/revision and consumes the batch once. Copying a
  batch is not a safe retry mechanism. There is no global duplicate suppression.
- `behavior_intent.*`: intent emission from behavior leaves and caller-owned RNG.
- `navigation.*`: incremental directed-graph route search, at most 256 nodes and
  2,048 links. Positive link costs, capability gates and revision-scoped routes.
- `surface_navigation.*`: validated BSP-style convex polygon resources, height-aware
  projection, budgeted BFS and revision-scoped portal routes. Separate from the
  small graph, with no Halo dependencies; see [geometry navigation](../../docs/navigation.md).
- `traversal.*`: route following, smart-link callbacks and reservation cleanup;
  stale graph revisions require replanning.
- `fire_control.*`: automatic fire, tap cadence and bounded charged-shot holds,
  mandatory release ticks, and immediate release on lost firing intent.
- `aim.*`: a difficulty-owned, nonzero aim-error cone scaled by range, tracking
  time and movement.
- `claims.*`: fixed-capacity, independently scoped object claims with expiry,
  renewal and owner release. Halo uses one scope per team (scope 0 for FFA);
  claims coordinate teammates, not opponents, and do not reserve objects from
  humans.

No heap allocation, ECS, timeline, navmesh generation, replicated bot protocol,
objective policy or weapon selection policy is provided by these modules.
Graph arrays must remain alive and immutable during a search; changing links
requires a new graph revision. Snapshot/serialization is the caller's concern;
raw structs and pointers are not a wire format.

## Halo integration

`source/features/bots/bots.c` supplies perception, behavior leaves, a spawn-location
navigation graph, weapon handling and player lifecycle. Accepted intents become
Halo `player_action` inputs through the host queue. Native builds discover these
C sources under `source/`; they are compiled into the macOS target.

See [the bot milestone scope and test notes](../../docs/bots.md).

The behavior runner covers the available behavior/definition tests. Timeline,
ECS, standalone intent and behavior-intent runners from the original engine
are not present here; their former documentation references are not claims of
coverage in this repository.
